### Reproducibility report for "Stokes drag on conglomerates of spheres"

Contribution to the ["Ten Years Reproducibility Challenge"](https://github.com/ReScience/ten-years) run by [ReScience C](https://rescience.github.io/).

**Reference:** Cichocki B, Hinsen K (1995) Stokes drag on conglomerates of spheres. Phys. Fluids 7:286. [DOI:10.1063/1.868626](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.868626)

**Open access version:** none. I have prepared a [summary](summary.org) which contains in particular the results that I plan to reproduce.

I update my [notes](notes.org) as the work progresses. Most of the repository consists of a copy of the [ReScience article template](https://github.com/ReScience/template) which has so far not been modified.
